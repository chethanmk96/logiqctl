# Overview

## What is logiqctl?

The LOGIQ observability platform provides a command-line client to interact with the platform. The command-line client is distributed as `logiqctl` \(inspired by Kubernetes' `kubectl`\)

The `logiqctl` source code is made freely available on github [here](https://github.com/logiqai/logiqctl) to make it easy for users to integrate the platform with their own workflows.
