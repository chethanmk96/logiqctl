# Contributing

No preference. If you know how to use Github and have contributed to open source projects before then:

* File an issue
* Submit a pull request
* File an issue + Submit a pull request
* Use this project somewhere :\)

Be sure to add yourself to the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/logiqai/logiqctl/tree/21d7cfb18f20daa606c2eb00d6236892e77feb04/AUTHORS/README.md) file when you submit your PR\(s\). Every contribution counts no how big or small!

Thanks for using Bitcask!
